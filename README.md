# Algorithms and Data Structures.
## Solutions of tasks.
[Course by stepik.org, provided by Mail.Ru group.](https://stepik.org/course/156)

This repository contains solutions for programming tasks.
Language - JavaScript (Node.JS environment).

Texts of tasks are published here according the licence [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

You can use the solutions as you want: copy, sell, print and send your granny by post, etc.

### How to run the code

Each script uses system stdin for input and stdout (console.log) for output.

You should have Node.JS installed on your computer.

How to do that read [here](https://nodejs.org/).

I use ECMAScript 2015, so you need the latest version of Node.JS.

In your terminal run:
```
git clone https://github.com/dendavidov/learn_algorithms-and-data-structures.git

cd learn_algorithms-and-data-structures

node task.X.X.X.js
```
where X.X.X - postfix of the script.

After that you can input data as it is required by the task.

Good luck!
